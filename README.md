Enthusiastic and adaptable software developer seeking a role that values creativity, innovation and ongoing personal growth. I take pride in writing clean, efficient code and tackling complex problems with thoughtful, well-planned solutions. I believe in careful design from the outset, always considering the wider implications of each technical decision. My experience in a small software company has given me end-to-end development exposure, while earlier positions have helped me build strong complementary skills.<br>
Dependable, hardworking, and conscientious, I am easy to work with and quick to adapt. I bring full stack expertise and a knack for improving web apps with fresh ideas and solid execution.<br>
Detail-oriented and driven, I thrive on solving challenges and building meaningful software — coding is something I genuinely enjoy.<br>
Note that I’m open to performing other roles, but my ideal role will involve programming, as I truly enjoy the creative problem-solving it brings.<br><br>
